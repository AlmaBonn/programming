## Programming "Algorithmische Mathematik"

The main purpose of this repository is to support the Wiki.

We will use it to collect occasional example programs.
These are meant to be illustrative, instructive and fun.
They may use technical programming beyond the scope of the class.

The example programs are meant to be used from the Arduino IDE.
Nonetheless, it is not difficult to run them without the IDE
by compiling them yourself, providing your own main function,
removing any LED control and exchanging 'Serial' with your own output.

We also provide a [rationale for choosing hardware](elementar.md).

There is an inofficial list of the [lecture's contents](almawochen.md).
