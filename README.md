## Programming "Algorithmische Mathematik"

The main purpose of this repository is to support the Wiki.

We will use it to collect occasional example programs.
These are meant to be illustrative, instructive and fun.
They may use technical programming beyond the scope of the class.

We also provide a [rationale for choosing hardware](elementar.md).

There is an inofficial list of the [lecture's contents](almawochen.md).
